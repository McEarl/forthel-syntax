  <p class="description">
    This page contains a complete reference for the syntax of ForTheL.
    ForTheL (<b>For</b>mal <b>The</b>ory <b>L</b>anguage) is a controlled
    natural language for writing mathematical texts.
    It is the input language of the proof assistant
    <a href="{{ page.naproche }}">Naproche</a> which is currently developed
    at the University of Bonn, Germany, and since 2021 a component of the
    <a href="{{ page.isabelle }}">Isabelle</a> prover platform.
    ForTheL comes in two variants:
    It has an ASCII dialect, which is the original plain text format of
    ForTheL, and a LaTeX dialect, which is an integration of ForTheL into
    LaTeX which allows to convert ForTheL texts easily to PDF.
    Check out their references via the links below.
